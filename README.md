## Installation

### Configure default location folder

* Open file and add the environment variable `EXT_LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM` with the folder location value. Example: `EXT_LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM=/data/files`
  * For Windows OS use the `refine.bat` to start OpenRefine, additional configuration in `refine.ini` won't be loaded using the `openrefine.exe` executable. Example `EXT_LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM=C:\\Users\\Home\\Desktop`
